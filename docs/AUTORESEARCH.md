# Voice Harness Autoresearch

This is the durable, sanitized research notebook for improving the fast voice
coordinator. Exact transcripts, session identifiers, tool results, and private
deployment data stay in the retained runtime audit log and never enter this
public repository.

## Safety boundary

- Never inspect, focus, message, archive, or otherwise interact with the
  explicitly excluded existing session.
- Live experiments use clearly titled disposable research sessions created for
  this purpose. Do not reuse unrelated user work.
- Mutating eval cases run only against those disposable sessions. Historical
  replay and synthetic coordinator transports are preferred for prompt search.
- Do not commit credentials, private output, personal paths, account or channel
  identifiers, raw transcripts, or deployment-specific values.
- A candidate may deploy only after conventional tests, the full regression
  corpus, and held-out cases pass without a safety regression.

## Method

Each iteration follows the same loop:

1. Observe a rough interaction or generate a realistic ASR-style flow.
2. State a falsifiable hypothesis about the harness, tool contract, or state.
3. Run the unchanged candidate harness over the complete regression corpus and
   separate held-out cases.
4. Score deterministic behavior directly: tool choice, target, arguments,
   delivery mode, focus mutation, and forbidden claims.
5. Judge final speech for grounding, reference resolution, honesty, brevity,
   and whether it answers the human's actual intent.
6. Promote every useful failure to a sanitized regression case before changing
   the harness.
7. Retain a change only when aggregate and safety-gate results improve without
   overfitting one wording.

ASR-style cases should resemble real spontaneous speech: run-on phrasing,
self-correction, filler, repeated words, missing punctuation, homophone-like
substitutions, and occasional dropped nouns. Clean paraphrases remain in the
corpus so robustness does not come at the expense of ordinary language.

## Scorecard

The primary gates are binary and weighted by consequence:

- Correct tool or direct speech decision.
- Correct session target without an unrequested focus change.
- Faithful action arguments; no invented or duplicated mutation.
- Grounded final answer from the supplied coordinator evidence.
- No false claim that an action happened or that monitoring will continue.
- Brief, natural speech that preserves required blockers or questions.

Latency, prompt tokens, completion tokens, and tool rounds are recorded as
secondary metrics. A faster wrong action never counts as an improvement.

## Research log

### 2026-08-28 — Baseline and measurement validity

Deployed baseline: `ab8a790`.

Observed baseline:

- 24 conventional tests pass.
- 17 retained-history first-decision cases pass after prompt tuning.
- 10 supplied-result tool-loop cases produce grounded final speech.
- The structured output contract is chronological within the most recent page;
  incremental output follows the same oldest-to-newest direction.

Validity threat: the replay command imports the production prompts and safety
filters but separately constructs tool definitions, coordinator context, model
requests, and tool rounds. Therefore it is a close simulation, not proof that
the exact production harness would behave identically.

Hypothesis H1: refactoring production and evaluation to use one request/tool
loop with injected model and coordinator transports will eliminate silent
contract drift and reveal at least one missing production-only behavior in the
current eval corpus.

Planned test: capture requests from production-mode and replay-mode invocations
for the same frozen state and assert byte-equivalent messages, visible tools,
model parameters, and tool-result serialization. Then rerun the baseline corpus
through that shared implementation before changing behavior.

Result: accepted. Replay now instantiates the production conversation class and
the production in-process MCP client. Only the coordinator executor is frozen;
prompt assembly, context contract, dynamic tool gating, schemas, result
serialization, model parameters, tool rounds, memory restoration, and failure
handling are shared production code. A conventional test drives restored
history through that complete path and captures both model rounds and the MCP
mutation. The suite now has 25 tests at this checkpoint.

The exact path revealed previously hidden drift: replay had encoded a proactive
update as one object, while production stores an array of events. It also
revealed that decision-only scores missed false success claims after a tool
returned an explicit error.

### 2026-08-28 — Tool-error truthfulness

Hypothesis H2: a stronger global prompt sentence is sufficient to make the fast
model distinguish current tool failure from older successful action history.

Test: replay eight historical ASR-style send and read turns with no supplied
tool result, causing a controlled coordinator error. The baseline and prompt
suffix each produced only one strictly truthful response out of eight; typical
failures claimed a send succeeded, treated a failed read as an empty result, or
promised a future retry. Reject the prompt-only change.

Revised hypothesis H2b: tool execution failure is a narrow runtime invariant,
not a semantic judgment. Deterministic per-tool failure speech should eliminate
false action claims and avoid an unnecessary second model request without
changing successful flows.

Result: accepted. All eight failure cases produced truthful, immediate failure
speech in one model round. Eight corresponding successful send flows still
acknowledged the confirmed target, and six supplied chronological read flows
grounded the answer in the latest message. Conventional tests are now 26, with
a regression asserting that the second model request is skipped on error.

### 2026-08-28 — Durable corpus and authoritative state

Hypothesis H3: a sanitized corpus with structured expectations can distinguish
general harness improvements from fixes that merely fit one retained phrase.

Result: accepted. The evaluator now runs the production conversation and MCP
loop over 24 public sanitized cases. It scores tool sequence, arguments, target,
speech requirements, rounds, latency, and tokens. Cases cover ASR corruption,
resend versus visibility, action-ledger truth, sticky focus, background
references, chronological output, delivery modes, archive restoration,
structured approval, context honesty, errors, and fresh output deltas. Repeated
trials expose stochastic behavior. HTTP rate-limit and transport failures are
invalid trials; unusable successful responses remain harness failures.

Two initial false negatives required exact words where faithful synonyms were
acceptable. After correcting those rubric bugs, the stable weaknesses were:
prior-send verification and fresh output-delta use each passed zero of five,
already-focused handling passed three of five, and honest correction passed
four of five.

Hypothesis H4: another global system-prompt sentence will make the model prefer
authoritative state over redundant reads.

Result: rejected. The global suffix did not change either zero-of-five state
failure. Removing read tools was also rejected because the model often returned
an empty completion when its preferred read capability disappeared.

Revised hypothesis H4b: keep read tools, put the evidence rule in the late
current-turn invariant, hide only provably redundant capabilities, and
explicitly distinguish a declarative missed-action complaint from a question
about visible output. The runtime already calls `check_updates`; conservative
focused-name matching can hide `focus_session` when that target is active.

Result: accepted. The four unstable flows each passed five of five targeted
trials. The missed-send and visibility boundary passed five of five on both
original cases. Three held-out paraphrases chose the correct tool in all fifteen
trials; one speech check was relaxed because all five correct answers confirmed
visibility without unnecessarily repeating the message body. The expanded full
run passed all 22 valid trials; the two late trials invalidated by HTTP 429 were
rerun individually and both passed, completing a 24-of-24 candidate result with
no untested cases. Conventional tests are now 29.

### 2026-08-28 — Delivery evidence and stateful multi-session flows

A disposable two-session live experiment confirmed immediate coordinator
acceptance in roughly 0.3 seconds, while a subsequent output read could still
show no corresponding user item. This exposed an evidence boundary: accepted
delivery and visible conversation output are different facts.

Hypothesis H5: a visibility answer should combine the authoritative action
ledger with the read result instead of treating absent output as failed
delivery or as the absence of an agent response.

The baseline passed zero of five accepted-but-not-yet-visible trials. A scoped
late invariant passed the original visibility and resend boundaries plus three
new held-out cases in all 25 targeted trials. The public isolated corpus now has
27 cases. This candidate was held rather than deployed because isolated turns
did not exercise working memory across concurrent sessions.

Hypothesis H6: one persistent production conversation and MCP connection will
expose reference, cursor, and action-selection failures hidden by isolated
cases. Four sanitized scenarios now cover 23 linked turns: an unrelated
completion while focus remains sticky; chronological output chunks arriving
between human utterances; an action request competing with fresh output;
back-to-back notifications from two sessions; explicit switching; temporary
side work; and deterministic focus restoration after archive.

Result so far: supported. The production invariant passed 21 of 23 turns and
only two of four complete scenarios on its first clean run. A notification
follow-up used the focused ID instead of the notified ID, and “what's new since
then” redundantly read older output instead of using the fresh delta. Repeated
baseline trials reproduced those two target-selection failures three of three
times; a separate run also interpreted the ASR repair “no wait” as queued
delivery. Thirteen of 69 repeated turns hit HTTP 429 and were treated as invalid,
not quality failures.

Candidate H6 makes notification records authoritative for reference resolution,
defines changed output as the chronological delta for “what's new” questions,
and limits queued delivery to explicit timing language. It also includes H5's
delivery-versus-visibility rule. The first clean candidate run passed all 23
stateful turns, and the unchanged isolated corpus passed 27 of 27. Repeated
stateful stability trials remain the promotion gate.
