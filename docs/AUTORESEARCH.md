# Voice Harness Autoresearch

This is the durable, sanitized research notebook for improving the fast voice
coordinator. Exact transcripts, session identifiers, tool results, and private
deployment data stay in the retained runtime audit log and never enter this
public repository.

## Safety boundary

- Never inspect, focus, message, archive, or otherwise interact with the
  explicitly excluded existing session.
- Live experiments use clearly titled disposable research sessions created for
  this purpose. Do not reuse unrelated user work.
- Mutating eval cases run only against those disposable sessions. Historical
  replay and synthetic coordinator transports are preferred for prompt search.
- Do not commit credentials, private output, personal paths, account or channel
  identifiers, raw transcripts, or deployment-specific values.
- A candidate may deploy only after conventional tests, the full regression
  corpus, and held-out cases pass without a safety regression.

## Method

Each iteration follows the same loop:

1. Observe a rough interaction or generate a realistic ASR-style flow.
2. State a falsifiable hypothesis about the harness, tool contract, or state.
3. Run the unchanged candidate harness over the complete regression corpus and
   separate held-out cases.
4. Score deterministic behavior directly: tool choice, target, arguments,
   delivery mode, focus mutation, and forbidden claims.
5. Judge final speech for grounding, reference resolution, honesty, brevity,
   and whether it answers the human's actual intent.
6. Promote every useful failure to a sanitized regression case before changing
   the harness.
7. Retain a change only when aggregate and safety-gate results improve without
   overfitting one wording.

ASR-style cases should resemble real spontaneous speech: run-on phrasing,
self-correction, filler, repeated words, missing punctuation, homophone-like
substitutions, and occasional dropped nouns. Clean paraphrases remain in the
corpus so robustness does not come at the expense of ordinary language.

## Scorecard

The primary gates are binary and weighted by consequence:

- Correct tool or direct speech decision.
- Correct session target without an unrequested focus change.
- Faithful action arguments; no invented or duplicated mutation.
- Grounded final answer from the supplied coordinator evidence.
- No false claim that an action happened or that monitoring will continue.
- Brief, natural speech that preserves required blockers or questions.

Latency, prompt tokens, completion tokens, and tool rounds are recorded as
secondary metrics. A faster wrong action never counts as an improvement.

## Research log

### 2026-08-28 — Baseline and measurement validity

Deployed baseline: `ab8a790`.

Observed baseline:

- 24 conventional tests pass.
- 17 retained-history first-decision cases pass after prompt tuning.
- 10 supplied-result tool-loop cases produce grounded final speech.
- The structured output contract is chronological within the most recent page;
  incremental output follows the same oldest-to-newest direction.

Validity threat: the replay command imports the production prompts and safety
filters but separately constructs tool definitions, coordinator context, model
requests, and tool rounds. Therefore it is a close simulation, not proof that
the exact production harness would behave identically.

Hypothesis H1: refactoring production and evaluation to use one request/tool
loop with injected model and coordinator transports will eliminate silent
contract drift and reveal at least one missing production-only behavior in the
current eval corpus.

Planned test: capture requests from production-mode and replay-mode invocations
for the same frozen state and assert byte-equivalent messages, visible tools,
model parameters, and tool-result serialization. Then rerun the baseline corpus
through that shared implementation before changing behavior.
